Custom Site Info (Wordpress plugin)
===================================

This plugin creates a Wordpress admin page/section that can be populated with arbitrary content (like notes/info from the site developer to the site owner). Typically I use this to add site-specific information, like a style-guide, contact info, notes template usage, etc.
